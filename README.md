# Machine-Learning-GIS-based-analysis-of-price-elasticity-of-NYC-ferries-and-MTA-subways

This project was a part of the course "Big Data Analytics in Transportation Systems" at Columbia University, New York.
We analyzed the effects of COVID-19 and price changes (Sept'22) in NYC ferries operated by Hornblower to find out the exact routes that were demand elastic/inelastic to these changes.
To be more precise, we narrowed down the routes that were price elastic, and compared the footfall/passenger count with neighbouring MTA subway stations to check if the decrease in demand due to price increase of one mode of public transportation led to a clear increase in demand of another mode, or drove more people to shift to their own private vehicles (ongoing part of our study using traffic intersection data).
Time-series analysis, ML based forecasting and GIS based visualizations were common techniques used in order to achive the results.
Data for both NYC ferries and MTA subways were obtained from their respective NYC open data websites.
